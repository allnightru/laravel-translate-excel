This package converts all PHP translations from Laravel`s "lang" directory a single Excel file with
dot-arrayed keys. Each file comes to a separate sheet. 

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require insnsk/laravel-translate-excel
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-translate-excel-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    // this is the default locale which will be used as reference
    'main_locale' => 'en',
    // what locations would you like to have in your file
    'locales' => ['en','de','ru','ja']
];
```

## Usage

Just invoke the artisan console command:

```php
php artisan lang:convert
```

And get your generated file at 'storage/app/translations.xlsx'
You can specify filename as a parameter:

```php
php artisan lang:convert to my_filename.xlsx
```

After you translate the file in Excel you would probably need to get it back to your app.
So put your translated file "my_filename.xlsx" into "storage/app" directory, then run:

```php
php artisan lang:convert from my_filename.xlsx
```

PHP-translation files will be generated into "storage/lang" folder.
Just copy them back to your app root.

## Security Vulnerabilities

This package was made just for my needs, so it was not tested at all and the code is not perfect also.
Use it at your own risk.
